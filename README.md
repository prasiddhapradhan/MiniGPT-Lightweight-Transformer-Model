# MiniGPT-Lightweight-Transformer-Model
Overview

MiniGPT is a lightweight transformer-based model for text generation. This project implements a small-scale version of GPT using PyTorch, making it suitable for learning purposes and experimentation with transformer architectures.

Features

Implements a transformer-based text generation model.

Supports training and inference with customizable hyperparameters.

Utilizes PyTorch for efficient deep learning computations.

Saves and loads trained model weights for reuse.

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9+

PyTorch

NumPy

Torchvision

Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minigpt.git
cd minigpt

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv gpt_env
source gpt_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `gpt_env\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Training the Model

To train MiniGPT on your dataset, run:

python train.py

This script will train the model and save the weights to trained_gpt.pth.

Generating Text

To generate text using the trained model, run:

python generate.py

This script will load the saved model and generate output based on a given prompt.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter a size mismatch error while loading the model, ensure that your model parameters (e.g., d_model, n_heads) match the ones used during training.
